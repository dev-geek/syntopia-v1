# Paddle Subscription Cancellation Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded API URLs**
**Problem**: The code was using hardcoded sandbox URLs (`https://sandbox-api.paddle.com`) instead of respecting the environment configuration.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/API/PaymentController.php`
- `app/Services/PaddleClient.php`

**Solution**: Added environment-based URL selection:
```php
$environment = config('payment.gateways.Paddle.environment', 'sandbox');
$apiBaseUrl = $environment === 'production' 
    ? 'https://api.paddle.com' 
    : 'https://sandbox-api.paddle.com';
```

### 2. **Inconsistent API Endpoint Usage**
**Problem**: Different methods were using different API base URLs, causing confusion and potential failures.

**Methods Updated**:
- `paddleCheckout()` - Fixed customer creation, products fetch, and transaction creation
- `cancelSubscription()` - Fixed subscription cancellation endpoint
- `handleSuccess()` - Fixed transaction verification
- `handlePaddleUpgrade()` - Fixed products fetch and subscription update
- `verifyOrder()` - Fixed transaction verification

### 3. **PaddleClient Service Updates**
**Problem**: The PaddleClient service was also using hardcoded URLs.

**Methods Updated**:
- `cancelSubscription()` - Now uses environment-based URLs
- `upgradeSubscription()` - Now uses environment-based URLs

## Configuration Requirements

Ensure your `.env` file has the correct Paddle configuration:

```env
PADDLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production'
PADDLE_VENDOR_ID=your_vendor_id
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
CLIENT_SIDE_TOKEN=your_client_side_token
```

## Testing

A test script has been created (`test_paddle_cancellation.php`) to verify:
- API key configuration
- Environment settings
- API connectivity
- Product availability

## Key Changes Made

1. **Environment-Aware API URLs**: All Paddle API calls now respect the environment setting
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Improved logging with environment information
3. **Better Debugging**: Added more detailed logging for troubleshooting
4. **Service Layer Consistency**: Updated PaddleClient to use the same environment logic

## Verification Steps

1. Check that your Paddle API key is configured in `.env`
2. Verify the environment setting (`sandbox` or `production`)
3. Test the cancellation endpoint manually or through the UI
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Files Modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/API/PaymentController.php` - Multiple methods updated
- `app/Services/PaddleClient.php` - Service methods updated
- `test_paddle_cancellation.php` - Test script created (optional)

The subscription cancellation should now work correctly for both sandbox and production environments.
